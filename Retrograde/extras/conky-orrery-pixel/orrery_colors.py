"""Colour and size editor for Conky Orrery, with a live preview.

    ./orrery_colors.py [path/to/lua_orrery.lua]

Pick colours on the left, watch the widget redraw on the right, and only write
to lua_orrery.lua when you press Apply.

The preview is the real thing. Every render writes the candidate settings into a
throwaway copy of the script and draws a frame of *that* through
orrery_preview.lua, so what is on screen is the file Apply is about to save --
there is no second implementation of the widget here that could drift away from
the first.

Only the standard library is used. tkinter ships with Python and Tk 8.6 reads
PNG on its own, so there is nothing to install.

Almost every control is drawn on a Canvas rather than taken from ttk. The stock
themes cannot be pushed far from their 1990s Motif ancestry -- their scales in
particular still draw a hatched grip -- and this sits next to a preview whose
whole job is to be looked at. Canvas drawing is a few hundred lines but it is
plain geometry, and it means the editor can wear the same palette as the thing
it edits.
